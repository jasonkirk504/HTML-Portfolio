            <h1>Jason Kirk</h1>
            <p>
              I am currently a software engineer for L3Harris, working as a contractor 
              for the Federal Aviation Administration. I maintain air traffic control 
              system software and assist with in-house tool creation at request of the FAA.  
            </p>
            <p>
              In my current role as a Software Engineer at L3Harris Technologies, I have 
              been maintaining and updating software systems for legacy air traffic control 
              systems. My experience includes configuring air traffic control academy 
              training workstations through Python scripting within a RHEL (Linux) 
              environment, writing a Wireshark packet dissector for custom communication 
              protocols in Lua, and creating custom tools such as a portable report generation
              tool for air traffic control floor managers with C# and .NET WPF. Other 
              responsibilities include collaborating
              with cross-functional teams to refine project requirements, writing technical 
              documents adhering to the Waterfall model, conducting unit and build testing,
              and conducting code reviews. 
            </p>

              Alright, that's enough LinkedIn jargon. Like most of my generation, I'm super
              into video games. I have [way] too many hours in Counter-Strike. My other 
              various interests include learning game development with
              the Godot game engine, 3D modeling and sculpting low-poly assets in Blender,
              movies, chess, hiking, and last but certainly not least, the Philadelphia 76ers. 
              They are my reality television. I also spend a lot of time learning different 
              software and programming languages on Udemy, Youtube or GameDev.tv.
