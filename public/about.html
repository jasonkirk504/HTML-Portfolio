<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Jason Kirk</h3>
<p>I am currently a software engineer for L3Harris, working as a contractor 
  for the Federal Aviation Administration. I maintain air traffic control 
  system software and assist with in-house tool creation at request of the FAA. 
  
</p>

<p>In my current role as a Software Engineer at L3Harris Technologies, I have 
  been maintaining and updating software systems for legacy air traffic control 
  systems. My experience includes configuring air traffic control academy 
  training workstations through Python scripting within a RHEL (Linux) 
  environment, writing a Wireshark packet dissector for custom communication 
  protocols in Lua, and creating custom tools such as a portable report generation
  tool for air traffic control floor managers with C# and .NET WPF. Other 
  responsibilities include collaborating
  with cross-functional teams to refine project requirements, writing technical 
  documents adhering to the Waterfall model, conducting unit and build testing,
  and conducting code reviews. </p>

<p>Alright, that's enough LinkedIn speech. Like most of my generation, I'm super
   into video games. I have too many (way) hours in Counter-Strike. My other 
   various -- not strange -- interests include learning game development with
   the Godot game engine, 3D modeling and sculpting low-poly assets in Blender,
   movies, Chess, hiking, and last but certainly not least, the Philadelphia 76ers. 
   They are my reality television. I also spend a lot of time learning different 
   software and programming languages on Udemy, Youtube or GameDev.tv. Something
   that I am passionate about is open-source software. Sometimes it's just nice
   to see a community come together and promote open collaboration for everyone's 
   benefit... shout out Blender and Godot.</p>
